# Abstract
Project Topic: Stock Price Prediction Using the Naive Bayes: A Case Study of Oil Industry in China

This project examines the validity and efficiency of using Naive Bayes algorithm to predict Chinese stock market. In particular, we posit oil industry as the focus of our analysis and set out to explore trading strategies on historical data. The result suggests high potentials of applying Naive Bayes algorithm to forecast stock movements in China when long-period training data is available.
